MLB Game Scrape - The purpose of this notebook is to scrape fangraphs.com for the box score statistics for every game in the 2015-2022 MLB seasons. To accomplish this task, the notebook initially queries each team's landing page, and grabs the links to the box score pages for each of the team's games. Then, the notebook queries each of those box score pages, to return each game's box score statistics. I grabbed both the initial team's stats and their opponent's stats, because I'm going to want the full representation of the game captured by the box score statistics I'm grabbing. Lastly, I put all these box score statistics into json files, by year and by team.
Betting Line Scrape - This notebook's primary function is to scrape the website actionnetwork.com for gambling lines (both totals and spreads) corresponding to each game in the 2015-2022 MLB seasons. I took the data previously collected from fangraphs.com, and used the dates when games were played to query the website and collect each day's betting lines. I then put this historical data in a JSON file.
