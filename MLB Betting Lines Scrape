This repositories primary function is to scrape the website actionnetwork.com for gambling lines (both totals and spreads) corresponding to each game in the 2015-2022 MLB seasons. I took the data previously collected from fangraphs.com, and used the dates when games were played to query the website and collect each day's betting lines. I then put this historical data in a JSON file.
